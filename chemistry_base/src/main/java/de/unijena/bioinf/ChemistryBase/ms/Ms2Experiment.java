        Annotations are additional information, that might be present in the data or not. They are usually
        optional values and might be present in specific experiment types. You can use annotations instead of subclassing
        to extend the usable of the Ms2Experiment class.

        Annotations should be wrapped into a class, which is then also used as key
        For example: Instead of putting an annotation "Inchi" as string into this hashmap,
        you should create a class InChI that contains this string and then put this class into the hashmap
        Be aware that there is no support for subclasses. So annotation classes should be final
        Furthermore, annotations should be immutable. Prefer setting of annotations instead of changing the content
        of an annotation. The reason for this is that cloning an experiment will only do a shallow copy of the annotations
