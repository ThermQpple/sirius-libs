/**
 * A strategy to merge peaks from different spectra. Merging is done by picking all peaks in the same merge window
 * and calculate a new mass which represents them all. Their intensities are summed up by the merger.
 *
 * It is allowed to modify the parent peak and add new originalPeaks to it. But the mass of the parent peak should
 * not be modified. Furthermore, the intensity of the parent usually doesn't matter.
 *
 * ParentPeak may be null if no parent peak was found or if the parent peak detection should happen later
 *
 * Returns the list of merged peaks
