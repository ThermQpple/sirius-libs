/**
 * A parent peak detection strategy:
 * - mass of parent peak is given by user
 * - this may be the focused mass of the instrument, the exact mass of the compound or the mass of the precursor peak
 * - if there is a peak with exact the mass of the given input, than this detector assumes that the user know the
 * correct parent peak and the detector will use this peak
 * - if there is a peak that mass deviates in the maximum of the allowed mass-deviation-window and the precision of
 * the input mass, the detector assumes that the input mass is a focused mass or an exact mass and the peak is
 * marked as candidate for a proper parent peak. From all candidates the detector will take the candidate with
 * highest intensity.
 * Example: For input mass 128.2 the detector search for peaks in massrange [128.15, 128.25]
 * - if there is no such peak, a synthetic parent peak is created
 * <p>
 * TODO: This detector assumes that the ionization of the parent peak has charge (+-)1!
 * For other ionization types the detector have to be rewritten!
